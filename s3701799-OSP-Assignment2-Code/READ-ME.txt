#HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM#

Step 1
Copy and paste all the files into a folder or simply copy and paste the folder in a directory

Step 2 
cd into the directory where the folder is 

Step 3. To compile the code, run this command: make

Step 4. To run the program, run one of the command options

Option 1: 
./allocate firstfit

Option 2: 
./allocate bestfit

Option 3: 
./allocate worstfit


#EXTRA NOTES#

names.txt contains a large value of names to test the program, to add a new experiment file open Main.cpp file, 
go to line 6, you should see this: 

/* PROGRAM SETTINGS */
const int THREADS_VALUE = 8;		//number of threads 
int dataLength = 200;			//amount of data each thread allocates
std::string file_name = "names.txt";	//name of text file

You can change the value of threads from 1-20; Data length is the number of data each thread allocates;
file_name is where you can replace a new experiment file between the quotations. Do not forget to include 
the text file inside the folder where the code is. Recompile and re run the program.
